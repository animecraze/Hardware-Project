      <h3> Motherboard </h3>
      <p> A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, 
      including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material, 
      typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet. These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components.
      In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components. </p>

      <h3> CPU </h3>
      <p> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware that carries out the instructions of a computer program.
      It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a computer system. 
      The CPU is like the brains of the computer - every instruction, no matter how simple, has to go through the CPU. So let's say you press the letter 'k' on your keyboard and it appears on the screen
      - the CPU of your computer is what makes this possible. The CPU is sometimes also referred to as the central processor unit, or processor for short.
      So when you are looking at the specifications of a computer at your local electronics store, it typically refers to the CPU as the processor. </p>

      <h3> Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
      <p> A floppy disk drive reads/writes data onto a small circular piece of metal-coated plastic. It’s an electromechanical device that reads and writes floppy disks. 
      A computer program may give an instruction to the hardware so that a data file is written onto a floppy disk.
      Floppy drives do data transfer, small file storage and backup, and it’s used for software installation and driver updates. </p>
