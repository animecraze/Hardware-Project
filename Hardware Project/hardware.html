          <br>
      <h3> Motherboard </h3>
          <p> A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, 
          including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material, 
          typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet. These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components.
          In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
      <h3> CPU </h3>
          <p> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware that carries out the instructions of a computer program.
          It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a computer system. 
          The CPU is like the brains of the computer - every instruction, no matter how simple, has to go through the CPU. So let's say you press the letter 'k' on your keyboard and it appears on the screen
          - the CPU of your computer is what makes this possible. The CPU is sometimes also referred to as the central processor unit, or processor for short.
          So when you are looking at the specifications of a computer at your local electronics store, it typically refers to the CPU as the processor. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
      <h3> Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
          <p> A floppy disk drive reads/writes data onto a small circular piece of metal-coated plastic. It&#39s an electromechanical device that reads and writes floppy disks. 
          A computer program may give an instruction to the hardware so that a data file is written onto a floppy disk.
          Floppy drives do data transfer, small file storage and backup, and it&#39s used for software installation and driver updates. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
      <h3> Hard Disk Drive </h3>
          <p> The hard drive of a computer is a device that stores all the software installed on a computer, as well as all the data files created and used by this software.
          This includes any documents you have created and downloaded, such as photos and music. 
          The hard drive is a form of permanent storage, rather than temporary memory such as random-access memory (RAM).
          This means that when you turn off the computer, the files remain safely stored on the drive so you can use them again the next time you start your computer. </p>

          <br>
      <h3> ROM (Read Only Memory) </h3>
          <p> It contains the basic instructions for what needs to happen when a computer is powered on. 
          This is typically referred to as the firmware of a computer. The firmware represents the basic code to get the computer started.
          Once the computer is up and running, the CPU takes over. Firmware is also referred to as BIOS, or basic input/output system.
          On most modern computers, the read-only memory is located on a BIOS chip, shown on the left. The BIOS chip is normally plugged into the motherboard. </p>

          <br>
      <h3> Expansion Cards </h3>
	  <p> An expansion card (expansion board) is an add-on circuit board that is used to connect devices such as modems, sound cards,
          graphics cards, and network interface cards to the computer. There are three types of expansion slots found in modern computers: PCI, AGP, and ISA.
          They all stand for different things and perform different actions. </p>

          <br>
      <h3> Cooling Fan </h3>
          <p> The role of the computer fan is to pull cooler air into the computer to cool the hot circuitry, particularly the CPU.
          In a desktop the fan is typically a part of the power supply and draws air through it, helping to keep that part of the computer cool.
          If a computer's CPU gets too hot it will typically lock the computer, requiring a shutdown and reboot.
          If the computer does not have thermal check capability the overheating could result in a fire. </p>

	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3> Power Supply </h3>
          <p> A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. 
          Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage. </p>

          <br>
      <h3> Computer Ports </h3>
	  <p> In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices.
	  In computer terms, a port generally refers to the female part of connection. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices.
	  On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects.
	  Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices. </p>

          <br>
      <h3> Protection Components </h3>
	  <p> They are basically used to keep the hardware inside the computer intact and safe so they cannot be damaged easily or disturbed. </p>

      <h3> After We Finished Breaking Up The Hardware </h3>
	  <p> It only took us one day to take everything apart everything. </p>
          <img src = "Images/finished.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Finished Image" />

          <br>
      <h3> Putting Everything Back Again / Reassembling everything </h3>
	  <p> It only took us one day to reassemble everything because we're pros with screwdrivers and computer mechanics. </p>
