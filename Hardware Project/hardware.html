      <h3 id="BWS">Before We Started</h3>
	  <p> Here are the images we took before disassembling the computer : </p>

          <br>
      <h3 id="MB">Motherboard</h3>
          <p> A motherboard is a very essential part of a computer. It keeps many important parts of a computer together,
          such as a Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, connectors (for input/output devices), etc. The foundation 
	  of the motherboard is a firm sheet of non-conductive material, usually a sort of stiff plastic. There are thin
              layers of copper/aluminum foil, called "traces", that are on this sheet. These traces are quite small, and create 
			  the circuits that are between the different parts. The motherboard also contains many sockets and apertures that 
			  connect to the different parts. 
			  
      <h4> The Many parts of a Motherboard </h4>
			     <p> Here are some of the parts that a motherboard consists of : </p>
			        <ul>
			            <li> A CPU socket  </li>
		                <li> A connector to the power supply </li>
                        <li>Apertures for memory </li>
			            <li> Chips </li>
			            <li>Connectors </li>
			            <li> Read-Only Memory (ROM) Chip </li> 
                        <li> Expansion Card Slots </li> 
                    </ul>			  
		     <a href= "#MB"> The Motherboard </a>

          <img src = "Images/motherboard.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Motherboard." />
		  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="CPU">The Central Processing Unit</h3>
          <p> The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of a computer that is responsible for executing commands
              from the hardware and software. It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations 
			  of a computer system.  A CPU is typically a compact square that has many metallic connectors on it&#39s 
			  flip-side. It fits neatly into the CPU Socket, with a small lever to help secure the processor.
			  Modern CPUs heat up very quickly, and can get very hot. To help cool it down, and stop it from short-circuiting,
			  it&#39s basically required to have a fan near it.

          <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="FDD">Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
          <p> A floppy disk drive is a component of computer hardware that reads/writes data to and from a small disk.
              The floppy disk was primarily used to transfer data between computers from the late 1900s to the 21st century. 
			   Floppy drives do data transfer, small file storage and backup, and it&#39s used for software installation and 
			   driver updates. The disk is now replaced by newer versions of a disk drive (such as thumb drives) not only because 
			   they're more common and therefore compatible with other devices, but because they're more capable and can store much 
			   more data. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="HDD">Hard Disk Drive</h3>
          <p> A hard disk drive is a device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. 
              A hard drive is a secondary storage device that consists of one or more platters to which data is written 
			  using a magnetic head. The Hard Drive resides in the drive bay, along with the floppy disk drive and the 
              CD-ROM drive. </p>
          <img src = "Images/harddrive.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Hard Drive." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="CDD">CD-ROM Drive</h3>
          <p> The CD-Rom Drive stands for "Compact Disc Read-Only Memory". When it was first created, it could store 
		  up to 650 MB of data, which is very less compared to the immense amounts of storage we have now. By the 2000s, 
		  CD drives could read up to to 7.8 megabytes per second. CD drives were able to store more data than a floppy disk 
		  could. </p>
          <img src = "Images/CDdiskdrive.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "CD Disk Drive." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="RAM">Random Access Memory</h3>
	  <p> The Random Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware component that allows data to be stored/retrieved on a computer. 
          Unlike a CD or hard drive, RAM can access memory randomly (hence the name) instead of going in sequential order 
          find the piece of data. It makes it easier to find what you&#39re looking for, faster. </p>
          <img src = "Images/ram1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "One RAM." />
	  <img src = "Images/ram2.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "The Twin RAM(s)." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="CF">Cooling Fan</h3>
          <p> The role of the computer fan is to pull cooler air into the computer to cool the hot circuitry, particularly the CPU.
          In a desktop the fan is typically a part of the power supply and draws air through it, helping to keep that part of the 
		  computer cool. If a computer's CPU gets too hot it will typically lock the computer, requiring a shutdown and reboot.
          If the computer does not have thermal check capability the overheating could result in a fire. </p>
          <img src = "Images/coolingfan.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Cooling Fan." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="PSU">Power Supply Unit</h3>
          <p> A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. 
          Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting 
		  input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage. </p>
          <img src = "Images/powersupply.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Cooling Fan." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="CP">Computer Ports</h3>
	  <p> In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices.
	  In computer terms, a port generally refers to the female part of connection. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, 
	  speakers, or other peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a 
	  plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals 
	  between devices. </p>
	  <img src = "Images/cable.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Examples of computer ports." />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="PC">Protection Compnents</h3>
	  <p> They are basically used to keep the hardware inside the computer intact and safe so they cannot be damaged easily
      	  or disturbed. </p>
          <img src = "Images/protection.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Power Supply" />
          <img src = "Images/protection2.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Protection2" />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="EC">The Empty Computer</h3>
	  <p> This is how the remains of the computer looked after we disassembled everything : </p>         
	  <img src = "Images/finished.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Finished Image" />
	  <br>
          <br>
      <h3 id="RC">Reassembling the Computer</h3>
	  <p> This is how our computer looked after we put everything back together again:</p>
	  <img src = "Images/finished2.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Back To Normal!" />
	  <br>
          <br>
	  <h3 id="FC">One Final Comparision</h3>
	  <p> Here is how our computer looked before and after, as well as how it looked when we put it back, all
	      side by side: </p>
	   <img src = "Images/start.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Computer Hardware." />
	  <img src = "Images/finished.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Finished Image" />
	  <img src = "Images/finished2.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt = "Back To Normal!" />
     <p> Before -> Empty -> Reasemmbled. </p>
     <p> We were pretty close, weren&#39t we? ðŸ˜Š </p>
