      <h3> Motherboard </h3>
      <p> A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, 
      including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material, 
      typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet. These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components.
      In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components. </p>

      <h3> CPU </h3>
      <p> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware that carries out the instructions of a computer program.
      It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a computer system. 
      The CPU is like the brains of the computer - every instruction, no matter how simple, has to go through the CPU. So let's say you press the letter 'k' on your keyboard and it appears on the screen
      - the CPU of your computer is what makes this possible. The CPU is sometimes also referred to as the central processor unit, or processor for short.
      So when you are looking at the specifications of a computer at your local electronics store, it typically refers to the CPU as the processor. </p>

      <h3> Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
      <p> A floppy disk drive reads/writes data onto a small circular piece of metal-coated plastic. It&#39s an electromechanical device that reads and writes floppy disks. 
      A computer program may give an instruction to the hardware so that a data file is written onto a floppy disk.
      Floppy drives do data transfer, small file storage and backup, and it&#39s used for software installation and driver updates. </p>

      <h3> Hard Disk Drive </h3>
      <p> The hard drive of a computer is a device that stores all the software installed on a computer, as well as all the data files created and used by this software.
      This includes any documents you have created and downloaded, such as photos and music. 
      The hard drive is a form of permanent storage, rather than temporary memory such as random-access memory (RAM).
      This means that when you turn off the computer, the files remain safely stored on the drive so you can use them again the next time you start your computer. </p>

      <h3> ROM (Read Only Memory) </h3>
      <p> It contains the basic instructions for what needs to happen when a computer is powered on. 
      This is typically referred to as the firmware of a computer. The firmware represents the basic code to get the computer started.
      Once the computer is up and running, the CPU takes over. Firmware is also referred to as BIOS, or basic input/output system.
      On most modern computers, the read-only memory is located on a BIOS chip, shown on the left. The BIOS chip is normally plugged into the motherboard. </p>
